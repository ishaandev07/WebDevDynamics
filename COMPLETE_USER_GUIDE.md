## Project Upload & Analysis

### Uploading Projects

#### Method 1: ZIP File Upload
1. Navigate to the "Upload" page
2. Click "Choose File" or drag and drop a ZIP file containing your project
3. Supported formats: `.zip` files containing complete project codebases
4. Maximum file size: Varies based on system configuration

- **Framework Detection**: 5-10 seconds
- **Dependency Analysis**: 10-15 seconds
- **Total Analysis Time**: 15-30 seconds (depending on project size)

## Understanding Analysis Results

### Framework Detection
The system identifies frameworks with confidence scores:
- **High Confidence (90-100%)**: Framework clearly identified with strong indicators
- **Medium Confidence (70-89%)**: Framework likely identified with some indicators
- **Low Confidence (50-69%)**: Framework detection uncertain, manual review recommended

### Supported Frameworks
- **Frontend**: React, Vue.js, Angular, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot
- **Full-Stack**: Next.js, Nuxt.js, SvelteKit
- **Mobile**: React Native, Flutter (basic support)

### Analysis Results Display
Each project shows:
- **Framework**: Detected technology stack

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Upload Failures
**Problem**: File upload fails or times out
**Solutions**:
- Ensure file is a valid ZIP archive
- Check file size (reduce if too large)
- Verify internet connection stability
- Try uploading smaller projects first

#### 2. Analysis Errors
**Problem**: Project analysis fails or produces incorrect results
**Solutions**:
- Ensure project contains standard configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Check that main application files are in the project root
- Remove unnecessary files that might confuse analysis
- Manually specify framework if detection fails

#### 3. Build Failures
**Problem**: Deployment fails during build process
**Solutions**:
- Review build logs for specific error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are properly declared
- Check that build commands are correct for your framework
- Verify environment variable requirements

#### 4. Runtime Errors
**Problem**: Application fails to start after deployment
**Solutions**:
- Check start command accuracy
- Verify port configuration (must use PORT environment variable)
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Review application logs for startup errors

#### 5. Connectivity Issues
**Problem**: Deployed application is not accessible
**Solutions**:
- Confirm application is listening on 0.0.0.0 (not localhost)
- Verify port binding uses environment PORT variable
- Check for firewall or security restrictions
- Ensure health check endpoints are properly configured
